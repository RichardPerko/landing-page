# landing-page

Project from The Odin Project

This project was to create and format a webpage. 
I have to say at first I was very scared of this project. I was struggling
on the exercises for flexbox alot. After getting started and pushing through
I really started to make strides. Although it came out almost exactly the same
as the given example seeing that I can do this makes me much more confident
in attempting to make other layouts.
